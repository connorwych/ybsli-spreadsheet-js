              h1 Information
              p An interpreter is a trained bilingual who can translate quickly and efficiently between spoken English and British Sign Language (BSL). They will work in a variety of situations (medical, legal, meetings, workplace, conferences etc) to ensure that all parties communicate effectively with each other.
              p Depending on the level of qualification of the interpreter they may be suitable for different types of work. All the interpreters listed are qualified to work across a range of different situations, with some also  specialising in legal and/or mental health bookings.
